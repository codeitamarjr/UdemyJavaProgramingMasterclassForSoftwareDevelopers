## Exercises and challenges of this Udemy course:

### OperatorChallenge


There's seven steps to go through this challenge so you might want to have this video paused on this section while you're going through and refer back to this as you're completing the challenge.

Step number one is to create a double variable with a value of 20.00.

Step two create a second variable of type double with a value 80.00.

Step three is to add both numbers together then multiply by 100.00.

Step 4 use the remainder operator to figure out what the remainder from the result of the operation in step three and 40.00 is.

Now we have used the modulus or remainder operator on ints in this course but I'm confirming here you can also do the same for double a variable of type double.

Step 5 create a boolean variable that assigns the value true if the remainder in step four is 0.00 or false if it's not zero.

Step 6 output the boolean variable just to see what the result is and step seven write an if-then statement that displays a message 'got some remainder' if the boolean in step five is not true.

### DisplayHighScorePosition

You need to create a method called displayHighScorePosition, so it should receive a player's name name as parameter and a second parameter should be defined as a position in the highScore table, so what you need to do in this method is display the player's name, along with the message, 'player's name managed to get in position...' and then display the number they receive, the position number.

Then a further message on the highScore table, and create a second method called calculateHighScorePosition, it should be sent one argument only.

In other words only have one parameter which is the player's score, it should return an int.

And the return data should be '1 if the score is >1000', '2 if the score is >500 and <1000', '3 if the score is >100 and <500' and in all other circumstances return '4'.

So you need to call both methods and display the results.

You can come up with any player name, but the score of 1500, 900, 400 and 50.

So in other words, you would call the various methods four times to come up with this, and to be clear the displayHighScorePosition is a void method, so it doesn't have to return any data, and incidentally as I remember it, a void method can also be known as a procedure and a method generally speaking can also known as a function. So you may hear me using those terms interchangeably throughout the course. Procedure would generally mean a method returning type void.

### Speed Converter
1. Write a method called toMilesPerHour that has 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometersPerHour. This method needs to return the rounded value of the calculation of type long.

If the parameter kilometersPerHour is less than 0, the method toMilesPerHour needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

Otherwise, if it is positive, calculate the value of miles per hour, round it and return it. For conversion and rounding, check the notes in the text below.

        Examples of input/output:
* toMilesPerHour(1.5); → should return value 1
* toMilesPerHour(10.25); → should return value 6
* toMilesPerHour(-5.6); → should return value -1
* toMilesPerHour(25.42); → should return value 16
* toMilesPerHour(75.114); → should return value 47


2. Write another method called printConversion with 1 parameter of type double with the name kilometersPerHour.

This method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX km/h = YY mi/h".

XX represents the original value kilometersPerHour.
YY represents the rounded milesPerHour from the kilometersPerHour parameter.

If the parameter kilometersPerHour is < 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".

            Examples of input/output:
* printConversion(1.5); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 1.5 km/h = 1 mi/h
* printConversion(10.25); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 10.25 km/h = 6 mi/h
* printConversion(-5.6); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): Invalid Value
* printConversion(25.42); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 25.42 km/h = 16 mi/h
* printConversion(75.114); → should print the following text (into the console - System.out): 75.114 km/h = 47 mi/h

Use method Math.round to round the number of calculated miles per hour(double). The method round returns long.

How to use the method round and how it works?

The Math.round() is a built-in math method which returns the closest long to the argument. The result is rounded to an integer by adding 1/2, taking the floor of the result after adding 1/2, and typecasting the result to type long. The method returns the value of the argument rounded to the nearest int value.

USAGE EXAMPLE:

double number = 1.5;
long rounded = Math.round(number);
System.out.println("rounded= " + rounded);
System.out.println("with 3.9= " + Math.round(3.9));
System.out.println("with 4.5= " + Math.round(4.5));
int sum = 45;
int count = 10;
// typecasting so result is double e.g. double / int -> double
double average = (double) sum / count;
long roundedAverage = Math.round(average);
System.out.println("average= " + average);
System.out.println("roundedAverage= " + roundedAverage);

            OUTPUT:

rounded= 2
with 3.9= 4
with 4.5= 5
average= 4.5
roundedAverage= 5

TIP: In the method printConversion, call the method toMilesPerHour instead of duplicating the code.

NOTE: All methods should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: 1 mile per hour is 1.609 kilometers per hour

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.

### MegaBytes Converter
Write a method called printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes that has 1 parameter of type int with the name kiloBytes.

The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the megabytes and remaining kilobytes from the kilobytes parameter.

Then it needs to print a message in the format "XX KB = YY MB and ZZ KB".

XX represents the original value kiloBytes.
YY represents the calculated megabytes.
ZZ represents the calculated remaining kilobytes.

For example, when the parameter kiloBytes is 2500 it needs to print "2500 KB = 2 MB and 452 KB"

If the parameter kiloBytes is less than 0 then print the text "Invalid Value".


        EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT

* printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(2500); → should print the following text: "2500 KB = 2 MB and 452 KB"

* printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(-1024); → should print the following text: "Invalid Value" because parameter is less than 0.

* printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes(5000); → should print the following text: "5000 KB = 4 MB and 904 KB"


TIP: Be extremely careful about spaces in the printed message.

TIP: Use the remainder operator

TIP: 1 MB = 1024 KB

NOTE: Do not set kilobytes parameter value inside your method.

NOTE: The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces.
NOTE: The printMegaBytesAndKiloBytes method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### Barking Dog
We have a dog that likes to bark.  We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!

Write a method shouldWakeUp that has 2 parameters.

1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking it represents if our dog is currently barking.
2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has a valid range of 0-23.

We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.

In all other cases return false.

If the hourOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false.

        Examples of input/output:

* shouldWakeUp (true, 1); → should return true

* shouldWakeUp (false, 2); → should return false since the dog is not barking.

* shouldWakeUp (true, 8); → should return false, since it's not before 8.

* shouldWakeUp (true, -1); → should return false since the hourOfDay parameter needs to be in a range 0-23.


TIP: Use the if else statement with multiple conditions.

NOTE: The shouldWakeUp method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### LeapYear Calculator

Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.

The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

If the parameter is not in that range return false.

Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is a leap year, otherwise return false.


To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2.Otherwise, go to step 5.
2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return true.
5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return false.

The following years are not leap years:
1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
This is because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

The following years are leap years:
1600, 2000, 2400
This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.

        Examples of input/output:

* isLeapYear(-1600); → should return false since the parameter is not in range (1-9999)

* isLeapYear(1600); → should return true since 1600 is a leap year

* isLeapYear(2017); → should return false since 2017 is not a leap year

* isLeapYear(2000);  → should return true because 2000 is a leap year

NOTE: The method isLeapYear needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### DecimalComparator
Write a method areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces with two parameters of type double.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if two double numbers are the same up to three decimal places. Otherwise, return false.


        EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces(-3.1756, -3.175); → should return true since numbers are equal up to 3 decimal places.

* areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces(3.175, 3.176); → should return false since numbers are not equal up to 3 decimal places

* areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces(3.0, 3.0); → should return true since numbers are equal up to 3 decimal places.

* areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces(-3.123, 3.123); → should return false since numbers are not equal up to 3 decimal places.


TIP: Use paper and pencil.

TIP: Use casting.

NOTE: The areEqualByThreeDecimalPlaces method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### EqualSumChecker

Write a method hasEqualSum with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the sum of the first and second parameter is equal to the third parameter. Otherwise, return false.


        EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* hasEqualSum(1, 1, 1);  should return false since 1 + 1 is not equal to 1

* hasEqualSum(1, 1, 2);  should return true since 1 + 1 is equal to 2

* hasEqualSum(1, -1, 0);  should return true since 1 + (-1) is 1 - 1 and is equal to 0


NOTE: The hasEqualSum method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### TenNumberChecker

We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).

Write a method named hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if one of the parameters is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.


EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* hasTeen(9, 99, 19);  should return true since 19 is in range 13 - 19

* hasTeen(23, 15, 42);  should return true since 15 is in range 13 - 19

* hasTeen(22, 23, 34);  should return false since numbers 22, 23, 34 are not in range 13-19


Write another method named isTeen with 1 parameter of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the parameter is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.

        EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* isTeen(9);  should return false since 9 is in not range 13 - 19

* isTeen(13);  should return true since 13 is in range 13 - 19

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code.

### AreaCalculator

Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.

The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.

If the parameter radius is negative then return -1.0 to represent an invalid value.

Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.

The method needs to return an area of a rectangle.

If either or both parameters is/are a negative return -1.0 to indicate an invalid value.

For formulas and PI value please check the tips below.

Examples of input/output:

* area(5.0); should return 78.53975

* area(-1);  should return -1 since the parameter is negative

* area(5.0, 4.0); should return 20.0 (5 * 4 = 20)

* area(-1.0, 4.0);  should return -1 since first the parameter is negative



TIP: The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is x * y.

TIP: The formula for calculating a circle area is radius * radius * PI.

TIP: For PI use a constant from Math class e.g. Math.PI

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to your solution code!

### MinutesToYearsDaysCalculator

Write a method printYearsAndDays with parameter of type long named minutes.

The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the years and days from the minutes parameter.

If the parameter is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".

Otherwise, if the parameter is valid then it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YY y and ZZ d".

XX represents the original value minutes.
YY represents the calculated years.
ZZ represents the calculated days.


                EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

* printYearsAndDays(525600);  → should print "525600 min = 1 y and 0 d"

* printYearsAndDays(1051200); → should print "1051200 min = 2 y and 0 d"

* printYearsAndDays(561600);  → should print "561600 min = 1 y and 25 d"


TIPS:

* Be extra careful about spaces in the printed message.

* Use the remainder operator

* 1 hour = 60 minutes

* 1 day = 24 hours

* 1 year = 365 days

NOTES

* The printYearsAndDays method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

* Do not add main method to solution code.

* The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces
