## Exercises and challenges of this Udemy course:

### OperatorChallenge


There's seven steps to go through this challenge so you might want to have this video paused on this section while you're going through and refer back to this as you're completing the challenge.

Step number one is to create a double variable with a value of 20.00.

Step two create a second variable of type double with a value 80.00.

Step three is to add both numbers together then multiply by 100.00.

Step 4 use the remainder operator to figure out what the remainder from the result of the operation in step three and 40.00 is.

Now we have used the modulus or remainder operator on ints in this course but I'm confirming here you can also do the same for double a variable of type double.

Step 5 create a boolean variable that assigns the value true if the remainder in step four is 0.00 or false if it's not zero.

Step 6 output the boolean variable just to see what the result is and step seven write an if-then statement that displays a message 'got some remainder' if the boolean in step five is not true.

### DisplayHighScorePosition

You need to create a method called displayHighScorePosition, so it should receive a player's name name as parameter and a second parameter should be defined as a position in the highScore table, so what you need to do in this method is display the player's name, along with the message, 'player's name managed to get in position...' and then display the number they receive, the position number.

Then a further message on the highScore table, and create a second method called calculateHighScorePosition, it should be sent one argument only.

In other words only have one parameter which is the player's score, it should return an int.

And the return data should be '1 if the score is >1000', '2 if the score is >500 and <1000', '3 if the score is >100 and <500' and in all other circumstances return '4'.

So you need to call both methods and display the results.

You can come up with any player name, but the score of 1500, 900, 400 and 50.

So in other words, you would call the various methods four times to come up with this, and to be clear the displayHighScorePosition is a void method, so it doesn't have to return any data, and incidentally as I remember it, a void method can also be known as a procedure and a method generally speaking can also known as a function. So you may hear me using those terms interchangeably throughout the course. Procedure would generally mean a method returning type void.
